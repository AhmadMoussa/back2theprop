  ## The Autoencoder
  The autoencoder is an unsupervised learning model that utilizes an encoder and a decoder to learn a latent representation of data.

I love the autoencoder, because it's such a versatile model to have in your machine learning toolkit. While the regular autoencoder is a relatively simple model, it teaches you some of the fundamental concepts of deep learning, which gives you a foot in the door for more advanced models. Latent variable models and generative adversarial networks hence become more accessible.

## Origins of the Autoencoder
One of the fascinating things about the autoencoder is that there is no clear consensus about it's origins, and a cursory google search does not immediately reveal to us a clear
